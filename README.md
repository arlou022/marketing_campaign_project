# marketing_campaign_project

## Introduction

The main goal was to use SQL to query the data to measure campaign performance and gather actionable insights towards improving future campaigns and increasing business 
profits.

The project essentially consisted of:
- EDA - Mainly looked for anything that may impact analysis on the data such as missing values or outliers.
- Creating Database - Ensured data inputs and types were correct.
- Queired the data to calculate KPIâ€™s such as ROI and acceptance rates.
- Further explored the data to gather actionable insights such as determining factors to campaign success and discussed possible actions to take
